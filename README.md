Arduino Shield to test 1-3S LiPoÂ´s

There are KiCad Files (for 4.0.2) and the Arduino Programm here!

This shield has large resistors switched by mosfets, that gives the possibilty to change the load to the connected cells.

it measures the capacity and Internal resistance, you can plot the data in graphs if you like:

It is based on my prototype from here: http://www.designer2k2.at/mods/arduino/70-battery-tester
